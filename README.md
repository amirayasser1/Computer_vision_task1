## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 🖥️ Windows

## ▶️ Run the Application

After activating the virtual environment, start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 🔎 Command Explanation
- `main` → Name of the backend file (main.py)
- `app` → FastAPI instance inside main.py
- `--reload` → Automatically reloads the server when code changes (development mode)

If the server starts successfully, you will see:

```
Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Now open your browser and visit:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
